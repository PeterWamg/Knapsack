# Knapsack Algorithm

## Description
The Knapsack Problem is a classic combinatorial optimization problem commonly encountered in resource allocation scenarios. Decision-makers are tasked with selecting from a set of indivisible items or tasks within fixed budget or time constraints. The objective is to optimize by choosing the best combination to maximize a specific goal, such as profit, efficiency, or meeting particular requirements, within the confines of limited resources.

## Gold
There is a backpack with a fixed capacity and a series of items, each with its own weight and value. The capacity of a backpack limits the total weight of items that can be placed, and each item has a specific value. The goal is to select a group of items to be placed in the backpack without exceeding its capacity, in order to maximize the total value of these items.

## The two different types of Knapsack
### 0-1 Knapsack Problem
Each item can either be fully included in the knapsack or not included at all. This means that for each item, there are only two choices: either to place it in the knapsack or to exclude it.
### Fractional Knapsack Problem
Each item can be partially included in the knapsack; it does not have to be fully included or excluded. This implies that it is possible to select a fraction of an item to place in the knapsack rather than committing to the whole item or excluding it entirely.
